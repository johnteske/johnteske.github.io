concept:
- standardize code and styles for consistency in marketing campaigns
- automatically inline CSS and use helpers to handle other repetitive code
- work around limited Email Service Provider (does not allow embedded stylesheets or Outlook-conditional styles)

solutions:
    - streamlined development workflow with Gulp (and previously Grunt)
    - standardized layouts with EJS templates
    - developed helper modules for links with analytics tags, images, etc. to allow focus on content
    - standardized styles with Sass
    - created new layouts, including monthly newsletters and 'Week in Genius', a weekly summary of activities and social posts as part of the *Genius / 21 Century / Seattle* exhibition
