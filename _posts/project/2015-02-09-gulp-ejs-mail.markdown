#### Challenges
- limited Email Service Provider (no embedded stylesheets, no Outlook-conditional styles)
- no standard styles or central repository of code
- emails previously coded by hand, CSS inlined manually

#### Solutions
- streamlined development workflow with Gulp
- standardized layouts with EJS templates
- standardized styles with Sass
- created new layouts, including monthly newsletters and 'Week in Genius', a weekly summary of activities and social posts as part of the *Genius / 21 Century / Seattle* exhibition
