Responsive redesign by Shaun Kardinal, including more image-based layouts.
Worked with Communications team to reorganize pages and navigation menus for better user experience and easy mobile use.
Continue to make improvements and add functionality following soft launch.
Reduced average page load time by 35% and made improvements on perceived load time and browsing experience.
