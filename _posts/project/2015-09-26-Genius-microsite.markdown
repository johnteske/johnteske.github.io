#### Challenges
- design a site that reflects the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the exhibition
- allow for many types of content to be posted from the wide range of art forms and programming in the exhibition
- encourage social media sharing and comments

#### Solutions
- coordinated with Schema, who designed and developed site on Tumblr
- wrote jQuery scripts to help dynamically link content across posts and static pages
- created Jekyll static site generator to help manage content across a large number of static pages and to reduce mistakes when copy-pasting into Tumblr
- made performance improvements, including compressing assets
